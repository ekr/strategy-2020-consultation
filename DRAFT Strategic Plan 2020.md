# IETF Administrative Strategic Plan 2020


## Background

As set out in [RFC 8711](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8711), the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) was established to provide administrative support to the IETF.  It has no authority over the standards development activities of the IETF.  The responsibilities of the IETF LLC are:


*  Operations.  The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting activities.
*  Finances.  The IETF LLC is responsible for managing the IETF's finances and budget.
*  Fundraising.  The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.
*  Compliance.  The IETF LLC is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.


## Introduction

This Strategic Plan sets out the strategy the IETF Administration LLC aims to achieve over the next 3-5 years, within the scope of its responsibilities as set out above.  This strategy comprises the following components:



1. **Linkages**.  The organisations and communities that the IETF LLC is linked to and how that linkage is the top-level driver of the IETF LLC strategy. 
2. **Mission**.  This is a literal definition of what the IETF LLC does.  The mission rarely changes in the lifetime of the company.
3. **Values**.  These define how the company behaves as it follows its mission. These may change over time to reflect broader social changes.
4. **Strategic Goals**.  The highest priority goals of the IETF LLC.  These may be short-, medium- or long-term goals or a mix.  These are the big picture of what the IETF LLC is aiming to do in the next 3-5 years and so are the key setting that the board expects the company to follow.
5. **Strategic Transformations**.  These detail the changes that need to be made in order to achieve the strategic goals.   Each transformation details the current state and the desired state to transform into. These transformations should be achievable within 1-3 years.

The next level below this Strategic Plan is the various operational plans such as the IETF Comms Plan and the ED Goals, which are where specific projects and specific measures of success are defined.


## Linkages

As set out in [RFC 8711](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8711), the IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor.  In addition the IETF LLC provides financial support for the operation of the IETF Trust.

Consequently, this strategic plan should ideally clearly reflect the strategies of the IETF/IRTF/IAB.  However, as those are neither well understood nor well defined, these are extrapolated from IETF/IRTF/IAB expressed administrative needs and desires.  

Furthermore, as the IETF community is a dynamic one, with leaders and other participants changing at a higher rate than the 3-5 year horizon of this strategic plan, the IETF LLC commits that it will adjust this plan should IETF consensus shift



## Mission

The best possible support corporation to the IETF/IRTF/IAB


## Values



*   **Trusted**.  The LLC will uphold the values and policies of the IETF/IRTF/IAB as if they were its own.
*   **Transparent**.  The community can expect the LLC to keep it informed about its work and to keep comprehensive records which are public by default and only make them confidential where there is specific justification.
*   **Responsive**.  The LLC will act consistently with the documented consensus of the IETF community, adapt its decisions in response to consensus-based community guidance, and engage with the community to obtain consensus-based guidance for how it operates where none exists.
*   **Diligent**.  The LLC will always do its job diligently by following professional best practice, acting ethically and minimising risks.
*   **Evidence-led**.  The IETF LLC will use evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, as the primary driver of its decision making.
*   **Focused**.  The LLC will focus solely on its defined role and within its defined mandate.
*   **Equitable**.  The LLC will deal with all members of the IETF community equitably regardless of sex, race, geography, culture, religion, age, health or other status.


## Strategic Goals



1. To support the IETF in being the standards development organisation (SDO) of choice for those who want to develop Internet protocols that deploy at scale.
2. To support the IETF/IRTF/IAB in building a strong community of participants at all stages of the participant journey.
3. To secure long-term funding for the LLC/IETF/IRTF/IAB that is more than sufficient to meet their plans.
4. To ensure the value of the IETF is well articulated and well understood by sponsors.
5. To rapidly mature the IETF LLC into an organization that fully meets its values and has strong community support and approval.
6. To deliver a toolchain that is up-to-date and well regarded by users.
7. To provide the high quality planning and support services required for the IETF to hold productive meetings both in-person and online.

The discussions on the future of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) are at too early a stage for the LLC to understand if it should have a goal relating to supporting the RSE or what that might be.


## Strategic Transformations

The focus currently is very much on developing capability and capacity rather than higher level outcomes.  In part this reflects the age of the IETF LLC and in part this is because we do not have the data or even measurement mechanisms in place to assess higher level outcomes.

  </tr>
</table>


Our overall strategy process has significant scope for development.  Not all of the groups (IETF, IRTF, IAB and LLC) operate a formal strategy process and there is no process to align the outputs of those that do, though with the IESG making one appointment to the LLC board, reasonable alignment with the IESG is ensured.

There is also no public call for community input until near the end of the strategy process and only then indirectly by soliciting feedback on the draft budget.  This requires community members to time suggestions to ensure that they get onto the agenda for the strategy process.  Often these suggestions come outside of the strategy planning process leading to a mid-course correction for the LLC with subsequent unplanned budgetary impact. 

The LLC will need to liaise with the IESG/IRSG/IAB as they follow their strategy processes, where they are formalised, with the dual aim of both offering professional support and ensuring that the LLC strategy is aligned with and supports their strategies.

The LLC policy set is another key area which binds multiple parts of the IETF, and significant progress has already been made.  The next steps are to fill in the gaps, ensure the policies are fully bedded in with training and audit, and have ISOC sign them off as required in the LLC operating agreement.

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The IETF/IRTF/IAB is a complicated organization/cluster of organizations (even that description is a simplification) and it is difficult both for insiders to articulate the value it provides and for outsiders to understand that value.  This is problematic for the LLC as we need to be able to create a pitch for any potential sponsor that clearly and quickly articulates what value their funding will generate both to them and the Internet, whatever their knowledge of the IETF.

Sponsors, in addition to supporting the IETF for the value it delivers, are also increasingly concerned about how the organisations they sponsor operate, how they treat their volunteers and staff and what opportunities they provide for a diverse range of new participants.  To be able to explain this, we need to document the participant journey, a map of the different stages of participation (e.g. newcomer, leadership), at what stages people start their participation in the IETF, how they transition between them and at what stages they end their participation.  

The value proposition and participant journey together bring focus to our promotional content and with those in place we can develop significantly more content to enable us to deliver a compelling demonstration of the value of the IETF to current and potential sponsors.

The development of the value proposition and participant journey must be community led through the EMO directorate, most likely with significant support from the LLC.  As the form of the value proposition is unlikely to be something many participants are familiar with, achieving acceptance let alone positive agreement could be challenging and the LLC may need to use an interim value proposition for sponsor engagement if that would be significantly delayed otherwise.


### Transformations: Culture

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>8
   </td>
   <td>(For LLC services) A set of long-standing issues left in the “too hard” basket as the culture of opinion and debate cannot resolve them
   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>(For LLC services) An evidence led process in place to address all long-standing issues in the “too hard” basket.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>9
   </td>
   <td>Insufficient data on participants and their activities, motivations and expectations to support an evidence-led culture
   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>Sufficient high-quality data on participants their activities, motivations, expectations, etc to support an evidence-led culture
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


With particular regard to the services that are provided to participants by the LLC, a culture has built up where decisions are taken more on the basis of opinion and debate than evidence.  For example, someone has a good idea that we should provide X for participants and rather than ask participants if they want X, how they already obtain it and if it is a priority for them, a debate takes place on the merits of us providing it or not.  Sometimes this debate results in stalemate and issues get put into the “too hard” basket as a result.

We need to shift from this to a culture where data is the starting point for identifying what needs to change and why and what the impact will be.  As the transformation says, we need to shift people from lining up next to people with the same opinions and standing opposite those who disagree, to lining up together facing the data and working together to interpret it.

We already have some data available, such as stats on meeting attendees and the post-meeting survey, but making this cultural change requires much more data.  For example, there is a big set of questions on non-participation and barriers to participation which are crucial to providing better service to the community overall. Obtaining this data will require a wide ranging plan backed up with a major programme of surveys and technical analysis.




### Transformations: Performance

   <td>10

   <td>All key areas of our operations are measured in a comparable way

   <td>Insufficient benchmarking against comparable organisations including other SDOs
   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>All key areas of our operations are benchmarked against comparable organisations including other SDOs and that data is used to drive improvements.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


By measuring key areas of our operations and then benchmarking those against comparable organisations we can identify if any of those areas could be improved.  While some areas are measured in some ways, this is far from comprehensive, and benchmarking has only been ad-hoc and against a small number of factors.

 

The desired outcome is that 



*   we have identified the key areas of our operations and a range of factors we want to measure for them
*   these key areas are measured regularly and in a comparable way
*   we regularly benchmark these measurements against comparable organisations
*   the results of this measure drive a review and improvement process.

 

There may be an existing group of SDOs that share benchmarking data.




### Transformations: Funding

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>14

   <td>Limited number of ways in which we can receive funds and so we are leaving too much on the table.

   <td>Multiple “buckets” will be set up to receive funds, with multiple opportunities for contributions to be received
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>15
   </td>
   <td>Lack of clarity on why we need additional income, how much and in what form
   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>Clearly understood and documented funding framework that sets out what income we seek, from where and in what form
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


ISOC currently contributes close to 50% of our funding and while they clearly expect to continue with this for many years, there is no formal guarantee of that.  The lack of such a guarantee means there is notionally a non-zero risk of a significant drop in income, which a professional board should mitigate.  This mitigation would be a major strategy for the LLC, expensive and resource intensive, all of which could be avoided if ISOC were to formalise its commitment into a long-term guarantee.

Even with the ISOC contribution secured, the risk would remain to our funding, when looked at for both donors and sponsors that it comes through the reliance primarily on a small number of industries, namely telecoms and domain names.  This risk can be mitigated by new donors whose income is from different sources.

An important next step is for us to put this all down into a funding framework document that we can both use internally and share with existing and potential donors to eliminate confusion and provide assurance that all donations will be well used.

While the funding framework has been in development we have had offers of small amounts of money from a number of sources that we have not been able to take up as the appropriate “buckets” to receive the money have not been available.  New options for donation need to be added, including taking small recurring donations from individuals and accepting donations at registration time.

   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>Clear goal for remote participation, with a clear plan for managing the impact
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Running a cycle of three global meetings per year is a difficult and expensive task, and one that is going to get harder because of four growing issues.

The first issue is the increasingly adverse impact of the complex set of requirements that were developed by the community without relying on empirical data on the impact on meeting cost and venue suitability.  Data from the meetings team suggests that some of these requirements significantly reduce the number of suitable venues and that this problem is going to get worse due to the mismatch between increasing demand and the slow rate of new urban venue developments, giving venues higher bargaining power.  This issue needs to be tackled through the use of data to explain the impact of each requirement and identify and address the most problematic.

The second issue is the increasing awareness of the carbon cost of travelling and the corporate and social stigma surrounding that.  Given the ongoing high value of in-person interaction, urgent attention should be given to measuring and mitigating this carbon cost both for future and previous meetings.

The third issue is the medium term impact of COVID-19 and the possibility that in-person meetings may be suspended for a period and replaced with some form of virtual meeting.

The fourth issue is that of the future of remote participation, which continues to improve and remains free of charge.  Potential impacts include a significant drop in in-person attendance, which may make in-person meetings unviable or greatly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of meetings.  This area needs a plan.

   </td>
   <td>→
   </td>
   <td>Internally developed parts of the tool chain modernised to meets user expectations and future ready
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The area of IETF tools has grown organically over many years and due largely to the contribution of a small number of people.  This has delivered valuable functionality and we have a well supported, productive and featured-packed toolchain.  However, cracks have appeared and are growing:



*   The work is well understood by a small number of people while those wanting to get involved and contribute find it hard to understand how things are structured and how decisions are made.
*   There are regularly raised concerns about performance, functionality and prioritization of changes.
*   The focus has been very much on the details while bigger picture architecture and user requirements setting have had insufficient focus.
*   The implicit architecture of custom building everything seems increasingly unrealistic and inefficient in a world of cloud apps, APIs and web services.

This area needs work to deliver a modern tool chain, including:



*   Improved transparency on the issues, plans and work practices of the tools team
*   A new group to look at the big picture, set out a vision and user requirements
*   Existing tools overhauled to address problems with performance and interoperability and make them future ready.
*   A modern architecture that supports a diverse and interoperable toolchain. 
*   A well understood and high quality user experience across the toolchain. 

This is likely to require significant capital investment, increased community support and increased operational expenditure.

  </tr>
</table>


Our contract management process has a number of issues, including mismatched bidder expectations, low volume of bids, complex negotiation phase, poor tracking and transparency and no formal process for performance management.  All of this needs to be addressed in a new process, which follows current best practice. 

In addition, we want ongoing community engagement and support for our overall approach to contracts and key contract provisions.

Many other LLC operational processes work well but as they are largely manual they can be inefficient and won’t be able support new feature demands. This can be addressed quite easily by implementing a suite of modern apps.
